Type Conversion: (widening/implicit conversion)

Conversion happends when,
a. type compatible
b. destination type > source type
(byte -> short -> int -> float -> long -> double)


Type Casting: (narrowing/explicit conversion)
int marks = (int)(99.99f);

TYPE PROMOTION:
1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
2. If one operand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float or double respectively.
