Functions:
  - Block of codes performing set of tasks which is written once and can be called many times.
  - syntax:
    returnType name(){
      //body
      return statement;
    }

Methods:
  - Functions used inside class are called methods.

Parameters:
  - Parameters are the inputs passed in function definition.
  - Default parameters are the parameters which are called when no input is passed during function call.

Arguements:
  - Arguements are the inputs passed in function call.

Call by value & by reference: 
  - When function is called by value, then value copies are sent to the function definition and the change in function does not change the actual values.
  - When function is called by reference, then value address/reference are sent to the function definition and the change is affected in the actual values.
  - Java always calls by value.

Function overloading:
  - function overloading means naming different functions under same class with same name.
  - function overloading depends upon number and data types of parameters in function definition.

Scope:
  - scope is the area in which the variable is defined and can be used.
  - scopes are of 2 types: method scope, block scope
