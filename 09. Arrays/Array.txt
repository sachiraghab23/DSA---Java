Array:
  - Array is a list of elements of the same type placed in a contiguous memory location.
  - Array is zero-index element.
  - Array is static type. We can increase array size in runtime.

Operations:
  - create
    dataType arrayName[] = new dataType[size];
  - input/output
  - update
  - delete

Linear search:
  - Searching the element one by one in the array.
  - Time complexity: O(n)

Binary search:
  - prerequisite: sorted array
  - Time complexity: O(log n)  

Subarrays:
  - a continuous part of array
