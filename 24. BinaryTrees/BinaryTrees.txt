BINARY TREE:
  - Binary tree is a hierarchical data structure.

      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \ / \
  4  5 6  7
 /\   / \  \
8  9 10 11 12

In the above binary tree,
a. children of 4: 8, 9
b. No. of leaves: (6) 8,9,5,10,11,12
c. Parent of 6: 3
d. Level of 7: 3
e. subtrees of 2: (4,8,9) & (5)


Types of Binary tree traversal:
a. Preorder traversal
b. Inorder traversal
c. Postorder traversal
d. Level-order traversal

Height:
- height of binary tree is the maximum distance between root and node of the tree.

Diameter:
- No. of nodes in the longest path between 2 leaves of a tree.

Subtree of another tree:
- Given the roots of 2 binary tree root and subroot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and nodes values of subroot and false otherwise.
