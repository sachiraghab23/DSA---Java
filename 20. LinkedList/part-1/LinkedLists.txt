LINKED LISTS:
  - Linked lists are linear data structure which contains no. of nodes and each node contains one data type and one pointer containing address of next node.
  - Last node in linked list points to null.


Linked list methods:
  - addFirst()
  - addLast()
  - add(index,num)
  - remove()
  - print()
  - search()


# Check Palindrome using linked list:
(first approach)
  - find mid node
  - 2nd half reverse
  - check if 1st half = 2nd half
(second approach): slow-fast approach
