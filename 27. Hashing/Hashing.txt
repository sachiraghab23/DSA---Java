HASHING:
  - A technique to convert a data into another form using some function.

Hashmap operations:
  - put(key, value) //O(1)
  - get(key) //O(1)
  - containsKey(key) //O(1)
  - remove(key) //O(1)

special Note:
- Worse case time complexity: O(n)

HASHSETS:
- no duplicates
- unordered
- NULL is allowed

hashsets operations:
- add(key)
- contains(key)
- remove(key)

TREESET:
- sorted in ascending order
- NULL values are not allowed.
