Binary search tree:
- BST (Binary search tree) is a binary tree in which
  a. Left subtree nodes < root
  b. Right subtree nodes > root
  c. Left & right subtrees are also BST with no duplicates.
- Special property:
  Inorder traversal of BST gives a sorted sequence.
- BST makes searching process efficient.

Strategy:
- Most problems will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing into sub-problems & making recursive calls on subtrees.
