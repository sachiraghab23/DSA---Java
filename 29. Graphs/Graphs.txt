  c. bi-directional

Types of graphs based on weights:
  a. Weighted
  b. Unweighted

Storing a graph: (structure & representation)
  a. adjacency list

  i. Graph databases
  j. Research

Graph Traversals:
  a. Breadth first search (bfs)
    - Go to immediate neighbors first.
  b. Depth first search (dfs)
    - Keep going to the 1st neighbor

Cycle in Graphs:
  a. Undirected:
    - dfs
    - bfs
    - DSU (Disjoint set union)    
  b. Directed:
    - dfs
    - bfs
    - topological cost (kahn's algorithm)
